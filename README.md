## FEATURES
9 primary faction are included in this mod, while 7 of them will be playable and faction Lapismarine are always unlocked.
This mod is aim to provide special design. Every faction has unique power to fight, like a cannon on core and booster on hull, or bud system to wire things together makes them powerful.  
There is also some uncommon weapons, like Smartbomb, Deep Space Bomb, Mine Field Launcher, Blizzard Launcher, Dashing Torpedo, even Decoy Generator. The "Decoy Generator" is a special weapons which doesn't dealing damage, instead, it spawn a holo fake version of a ship which just looks like real, fool your enemies attack it and waste their firepower.  
Meanwhile, some features which didn't provide by normally gameplay have been used, such as Lapismarine Shield Disturb EMP: a weapons doesn't damage any hull but blast every hostile shield only, makes Lapismarine did really awesome things.  

Unplayable factious has something awesome too. Look out the wild blue shield bubble that they are not wrecks, they just become small if you blast them. Do not ever approaching the dark purple objects which just smash you no matter how large you are, they and even their wrecks are incredibly deadly.
